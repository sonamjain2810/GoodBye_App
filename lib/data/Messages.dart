    "You're one of the best people I've ever met. Best of luck for new life and farewell!",
    "No matter where you go, stay in touch always. Take care and goodbye!",
    "Saying goodbye is sometimes a part of life. But our memories will always speak for our true friendship wherever we go. Farewell friend!",
    "Today I take a moment to thank Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, Jan Koum, Brian Acton, Evan Spiegel, Robert Murphy, and Steve Jobs. Without them, we wouldn't have Google, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Snapchat and FaceTime. How else would I have possibly kept in touch with you? Goodbye."
    "I'm wishing everything best for you because that is exactly what you deserve! Goodbye! We will meet again, soon. Take care of yourself!",
    "Who will tolerate my annoying antics, who will calm me down when I am angry. Who will listen to my daily rants, who will make sure I am always happy. Who will I harass with my banter, who will I hang out with every day? I am sad and totally devastated, as my bestie goes away. Goodbye.",
    "You are leaving a ton of memories with us today. You'll be missed by each and every one of us. Have a great journey to your newest destination!",
    "Our friendship is the best thing that has ever happened to me. Talking to you made me smile and meeting you set me free. I can't believe that fate is taking you away and ripping us apart. I just want to say that I will miss you from the bottom of my heart. Goodbye.",
    "Farewell dear. It doesn't matter if you're with us or not, your works will always inspire each and every person in this office. Wish you all the best!",
    "I feel sick, I feel low, I feel depressed and I feel sad - when I think about how I will miss you real bad. I feel miserable, I feel unwell, I feel down and I feel lonely - when I think about how life will be without my bestie. Goodbye.",
    "You're the kind of employee any boss would like to have in their office. It's no wonder you're going to a bigger place. Wish you all the best!",
    "With the wind in our hair and the sun in our eyes, we cherished our friendship as life's greatest prize. Now that you are going away my life will cease, I will blissfully drown in all the beautiful memories. Goodbye.",
    "We feel lucky to have worked under your supervision. Your guidance will be missed every day by each one of us. Farewell, Sir!",
    "When the sun says goodbye to earth, it leaves a beautiful sunset as a gift. When friends say goodbye to each other, they leave mementos of everlasting and priceless memories. Goodbye, my friend, I will miss you.",
    "No matter where you go, we will always be connected in our hearts. My heartiest good wishes will be with you always. Farewell dear friend!",
    "While seeing you off I may have a smile on my face, but after you leave I will be in a lonely place. My facade might be cheerful and happy, but deep down inside I will be suffering in agony. Goodbye.",
    "You are not only a great teacher but also a great human being. There are so many things that we have learned from you! You deserve the best farewell!",
    "Fights, girlfriends, boyfriends, arguments, lies - Nothing has ever come between our strong friendship. So a few hundred miles is not going to make any difference either. We are friends forever. Goodbye.",

    "You have always been a great companion for the journey. Saying goodbye to a companion like you is hard for me. Wish you all the best for your new life!",
    "My relationship with you, my friend is like a traffic signal. All this while, the signal was red, but now it's turned green. It's time for you to walk the road to greatness. Goodbye!",
    "It's tough to say goodbye to you. Your memories will keep you alive. Farewell!",
    "I kind of feel like making you hold a stick. But, even then, it's not possible to make you stick around. Take care. Goodbye!",
    "It was a great experience working with you. Thank you for everything. Goodbye!",

    "Go ahead and find your glory. But never forget the ones you shared the journey with. Wishing you good luck for the new life!",

    "Thank you for teaching me many things in the long run. I want to keep all these good memories in my heart and look forward! Goodbye.",
    "The absence of a friend is going to make me feel lonely and frustrated. There is nothing good about goodbye, it makes me feel lonely and suffocated.",
    "We learned a lot from you, and our heart will miss you to the moon and back.",
    "The only reason I am saying goodbye is so that I can get a chance to say hello again.",
    "Thank you for being the best companion on the journey. I will miss you, best of luck, dear.",
    "Since true friends never really say goodbye to each other, please treat this goodbye message as a mere formality and delete is as soon as you have read it.",
    "I hate goodbyes, so let's not say it! I hope you always remember that you have a supportive friend here, doesn't matter wherever you go! See you later, dear!",
    "The world will come to an end, as I say goodbye to my friend. But I know I'll pull through this pain, because I know we'll meet again. Goodbye.",

    "NO matter where you go and whatever you do, my heart and success will find you always. Farewell.",
    "Dear friend, I don't want you to leave, I refuse to say goodbye. I will just watch you walk away while my heart silently weeps and cries.",
    "I can not believe that you are leaving us. Let's stay in touch forever. Best wishes for the future.",
    "How can I say goodbye to a friend who I can't live without? I will suffer in silence but my heart will scream and shout.",
    "Saying goodbye is a part of our life and let's not be sad about this. Rather let's treasure all the good memories and look forward to the beautiful future. Take care of yourself, Farewell!",
    "The hundreds of friends on Facebook and Twitter mean nothing to me in any way, if I don't have real friends like you to meet every day. Goodbye.",
    "Dear, hope you achieve new heights and good things in the upcoming days. Wishing for a bright future with lots of positivity for you, take care of yourself.",
    "Don't expect me to come to the airport to see you off when you leave. I will be in my room, crying on my loneliness' eve. Goodbye.",
    "You have been a good companion and a great admirer. Thank you for all your support and encouragement. You are someone I treasure so much so please keep in touch!",
    "I thought 160 characters would be too less for a goodbye tweet on Twitter. But the thought of living without my best friend has left me speechless. Goodbye.",
    "Success will find you no matter where you go and what you do. As you leave us today just know that my heart will always find you in it!",

    "I hate saying goodbye to you, my dear. I will always cherish all our good old days and beautiful memories. I hope you know that this isn't the end, we will stay strong forever.",
    "When I say that bidding you farewell is easy, take it as a compliment. Because it shows how blindly I trust you when you say that you will come back soon. Bye, my friend.",
    "May God bless you with fulfilling your dreams and make this world a better place. Hope you will always stay true to yourself and make everyone proud! Adios!",
    "All the beautiful memories that we have made together as friends will be cherished and fondly remembered. I guess we have a lot to keep ourselves busy with until we meet again. Goodbye my friend.",
